Summary
=======

Atomic OS is a "live" OS-like environment and SPA library/template for web app development.

At it's core, Atomic OS aims to provide to web developers features that desktop dev's take for granted: basic operating system features like a command interpreter and filesystem.

Included in Atomic OS is a simple scriptable command shell and basic desktop environment, giving developers absolute runtime access to their RIA & SPA applications.

Atomic OS hopes to help ameliorate dependence on the cloud by allowing app data to be stored within the microsystem itself, using a storage strategy established by TiddlyWiki.

Because Atomic OS is simply an html file, it is instantly a template, infinitely reusable and extremely easy to distribute.


Building the Prototype
======================

Note: These build methods will be replaced by a common Node.js build system


Windows
-------

Open a dos box and cd into the scripts directory:

    cd c:\devel\Atomic-OS\prototype\scripts

After editing source files you must rebuild atomos.js by running buildall.bat

With the above path you can now view your build by visiting:

    file:///C:/devel/Atomic-OS/prototype/index.html

NOTE: Atomic-OS is not known to work in any version of Internet Explorer.

Documentation, unit tests and minification are not currently generated when building under Windows.

Linux
-----
The basic build process is the same as for Windows. Run script/buildall in a Bash compatible shell.

Install Node.js and the Node Package Manager (NPM) for additional features:

* The autobuild daemon in the scripts folder will rebuild Atomic OS for you every time a source file is saved
* Documentation and unit tests will be built if the environment variable DOCS is set and JSDog is available.  You can install JSDog with:  npm install jsdog -g
* Minification is handled by uglify.js:  npm install uglify-js -g
